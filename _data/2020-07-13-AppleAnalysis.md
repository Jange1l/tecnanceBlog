# Apple events and it's stock price

It is  no secret that Apple has some of the most anticipated key notes and product reveals of the year. With all of that attention comes a lot of speculation, and that is why today we are going to analyze how these events have impacted Apple's stock over the years. Then we will decide if there is any predictable pattern that can be leveraged to profit on some trades. In this article we will talk about options trading so if you are not familiar with those I highly recommend you go watch this youtube video here(INSERT HYPER LINK) to catch up. 

### WWDC 

Apple's WWDC (World Wide Developer Conference) is probably one of my favorite events of the year. As a software engineer who started out with iOS development I find these events to be extremely interesting. For those of you who don't know, WWDC is basically Apple's yearly announcement about what they have been working on in terms of software, development tools, plans for the future of Apple products and any other relevant things for DRUM ROLL . . . . you guessed it DEVELOPERS! Now you may be asking well why is any of this important to me as an investor. Well the truth is that this event is pretty much early access to fundamental information for the future of Apple and it's  theoretical performance for the rest of the year and sometimes for the years to come. You see it is important to see what  Apple  is providing for it's developpers because this is a  good way to gauge what Apple is prioritizing and what it want's it's developpers to focus on improving before bringing any change to market.
