# Introduction 

If  you are new to options trading then I recommend you go back and read my other articles that explain the fundamentals of options trading. In this  article I will go over the best way to trade Put Credit Spreads (PCS) in a way that  will  increase profitability, decrease risk, and provide a dynamic strategy that does not depend on strong market movements to see significant returns. If  you  are  familiar  with options trading but not with PCS I recommend this article (HYPER LINK HERE) to familiarize yourself with the basics of a PCS's. 


# 1. Choose an industry you are passionate about!

> The diversification statement applies for begginers, once comfortable with the strategy you can spread out to other industries. 


Although this  sounds obvious there is a good reason why I emphesize it. The general rule of investing is to diversify your portfolio, and I couldn't agree more. Diversification is very important, however, when it comes to PCS's that rule doesn't apply equally. In a regular portfolio you wan't to diversify the risk of your assets by being invested in many different industries (but not too many) to decrease the chances of loosing too much at once. For example, if you are only invested in oil companies then you run the risk that tommorow the whole world changes to renewable energy sources and very cheap electric cars hit the market. This would be catastrofic for the oil industry and would lead to a MAJOR loss in your portfolio. Now if you are invested in tech companies, gold, oil, and pharmaciticals then even if that happened the loss from the oil companies would be minimized by the gains of the tech industry and vice versa. 

When it comes to PCS's we wan't to take a different approach. Choosing an industry that you are passionate for will hopefully lead to you having a great amount of knowledge on this specific industry through personal interest. This knowledge is critical when trading PCS's. Being up to date on the latest news in the industry that you are invested in is very important and this can be hard to do sometimes when you aren't generally interested in that topic. 

For example, as a computer science major and a software engineer I am greatly interested in the tech industry and I am always researching about the latest and greatest things in the industry. Also, as a consumer I understand very well what most people are looking for, so whenver a company like Apple announce certain things at their developer conferences that I know will have a great positive impact in the future for developers and users (things that are sometimes overlooked by the avergae investor) I can better gauge my investment strategy for longer or shorter periods of time. 

With this passion and knowledge comes a general interest that will naturally keep you up to date with the latest news. This comes in handy(not only for PCS) because it allows you to better understand how certain events might affect certain companies. All of this becomes increasingly more important when trading PCS's because when doing so you typically want to focus on 2 - 5 comapnies. This is roughly the range of companies that are manageble for an individual investor to accurately track and manage positions on incase anything goes wrong. 

# 2. Choosing the companies

Remember that when you trade a PCS you are betting that the market will either go up or stay above a certain price. Once you have a good understanding of the industry, you want to choose companies that clearly have a lot of growth potential. Now, you might ask yourself "If I know that this company is going up why don't I just buy the stock and hold it?" Well the answer is because you can make a lot more money trading the PCS and you minimize your risk by not having to hold the asset for an extended period of time, which gives you more flexibility to do other trades and manage your risk all while allowing you to make more money as the stock goes up. 

#### While choosing your companies you want to look for the following characteristics

- Companies that you understand very well
- Companies with relatively high stock prices or larger market caps *(This leads to better profit opportunities)*
- Companes that are leaders in their industry
- Companies with clear growth potential
- Companies that invest into thier R&D *(Research and Development)* department 
- Companies that constantly inovate or release new products

> Nvidia and Apple are good examples of such companies in the tech industry. Although AMD is similar in some respects, it doesn't offer enough flexibility in it's option pricing due to it's lower stock price.  

These are all generally good indicators of companies that are leaders in their industry and that have a lot of growth potential in the future. 

# 3. Technical indicators and choosing the strike price

Once you have identified the stocks that you feel comfortable trading you can proceed to the technical analysis part. Technical analysis isn't perfect, but it does help us identify certain movements in the market that can signal to the potential momentum of the stock. In this case we wan't to make sure that we are able to identify windows of low volatility. So typically we wan't to avoid positions around earnings announcements or any other type of event that can cause a strong reaction in any direction.

>This is typically true for beginners. As you become more familiar with how the market moves you can start to leverage these reactions to profit even more, but it is riskier and remember that our goal here is to reduce risk.

### Indicators
 1. MACD 
 2. RSI
 3. Bollinger Bands
 4. Volume 


My favorite analysis tool at the moment is thinkorswim (ADD LINK HERE). To use their tools you need to have a brokerage account, but it is definitely worth it considering how many tools you get for free. Some good alternatives are TradingView and FactSet.

In the picture above we can see how all the technical indicators work together to help us gauge the market movement. In this example we see how the MACD was trending high above the zero line but began to gradually converg back towards zero. This is a good indicator of the slwoing down bullish trend. However, even though there were some strong sell signals in there, the RSI indicates otherwise. Also, keep in mind that this was a couple of days after earnings so there was a general positive impact from beating the expectations. Again this can still be a profitable trade if you know how to manage it properly. In this case I sold puts two weeks out at a strike of $415/$412.5 (the time i sold is indicated by the vertical orange line in the picture ) because the indicators were showing a slowing of the stock movement which transalted into the next day and already made my position profitable on time decay and a slight move upwards for the stock. Typically we would wait until expiration to make max profit on the PCS, but in this case since we have the positive impact from earnings it might be a good idea to take a smaller profit before expiration since there is a possibility for a price adjustment which could be below my strike. 

### How to look at them

1. I use the **MACD** chart to get a general sense of how fast a stock is moving in either direction. When selling a PCS we wan't the stock price to stay above our strike price so the MACD can help us identify whether the stock is behaving relatively stable or if it has the potential to accelerate in either direction. It is normal to see the MACD line fluctuate around the zero line. You should be concerned when the MACD line generates a strong sell signal or is way below the zero line and does not look like it is reverting soon. 

2.  When analyzing the **RSI** I tipycally look for stocks that are fluctuating between the 70 and 30 region. I like to set my RSI to a range of 10 days because I typically trade bi-weekly PCS although that changes quite often depending on the state of the market. I like to look at the RSI as a re-inforcing indicator to for my initial prediction. If I notice that the MACD and the RSI are both giving stron sell signals simultaneously for the last couple of days I might re consider my strike price if I haven't opened a position, close the position and take my losses or gains if it's already open, or consider a different stock given the uncertainty.  

3. The **Bollinger Bands** help me decide two things, when to open a position, and around what price I should be setting my strike price. Generally speaking when the Bollinger Bands are wide it is a good time to sell PCS because volatility is high and the premiums pay more for the same amount of collateral. 

4. **Volume** is good in general because it allows us to have an idea of how much of the stock is being traded in comparison to other instances in the past. Generally a spike in trading volume can be a good thing if managed properly, however, it also means that there is an increase risk of a potential strong shift in one direction or the other. So to summarize an increasing volume should be an alert to be more active and pay attention to what the stock and spread are doing so that you can minimize your losses if things go wrong, or take a profit while you can if you fear a down move. 

### Picking a strike price

Normally I like to go 4-5 strikes out of the money plus or minus one on each end depending on how safe I feel the market is at the moment. Remember, there is no one way to pick the perfect strike price and expiration date but we can use the indicators above to help guide our decision. 

## 4. How much collateral to use 

The amount of collateral that should be used to trade PCS is really up to you. For beginners I would say around $250 - $500 dollars is enough to start making some safe profitable trades. Always assume that the money you are investing is gone, because there is always that potential of losing everything so never invest money that you are relying on. 

## 5. Managing your position

Even though you can generally sell PCS and not think about them for a while, you should always sporadically check your positions to see where you stand. 

### Things to consider 

- If a lot of time left until expiration (been holding for less than half of the time frame till expiration)
    - If the stock price is **low** and close to the strike price, ask yourself "What is the probability that the stock rebounds?" 
    - If it's **high**, "How likely is it to stay here until expiration?", "Do I feel comfortable closing the position now and missing out on more potential gains?"
- If it's close to expiration 
    - **Low**, since you are working with a tighter time frame small movements make a big difference. What do the indicators show, is it selling time or buying time, should we roll the position or take the chances to expiration? Sometimes you are better off closing the position at a loss. 
    - **High**, probably best to hold to expiration because the odds of the stock dropping significantly in a short time period is very unlikely.
